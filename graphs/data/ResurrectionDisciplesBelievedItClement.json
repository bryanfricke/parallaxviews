Their suffering is presented as a direct result of their proclamation of the risen Christ. The author expresses admiration for their endurance and conviction, suggesting their deaths were the ultimate testimony to the truth of the resurrection, with no hint of regret or doubt.",
  "whyItMatters": [
    "It is an early external affirmation, written from Rome within a generation of the apostles' deaths, which shows widespread acceptance of their martyrdom.",
    "It portrays suffering as a witness, as the apostles' trials and deaths are seen as a validation of the resurrection message, not a defeat.",
    "It provides the perspective of the Roman church, reinforcing the credibility of resurrection preaching from outside the Jerusalem context."
