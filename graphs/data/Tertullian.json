  "details": "In a theological defense of martyrdom, Tertullian, a North African church father, references the violent deaths of Peter, Paul, James, and Stephen as both historical fact and theological witness. He claims their testimony was \"written in their own blood\" and encourages skeptics to verify this by consulting public records of the empire. He depicts their martyrdom as an open and verifiable event, born from their belief in the resurrection, and not as a legend or defeat. For example, he describes Paul's execution as a \"new birth\" that was \"ennobled by martyrdom.\"",
