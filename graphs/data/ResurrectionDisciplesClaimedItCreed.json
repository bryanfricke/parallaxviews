  "details": "The Early Creed is an early resurrection creed cited by Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:3-7. It is believed to have been formulated in the AD 30s, predating the letter written around AD 55. This creed is an oral tradition designed for easy memorization and communal recitation, with a formulaic structure rooted in parallelism, repetition, and careful sequencing. It includes core elements of the gospel, stating that Christ died for sins, was buried, was raised on the third day, and appeared to various individuals and groups.",
  "whyItMatters": [
    "It is viewed as an exceptionally early testimony to the resurrection, with most scholars dating it to within five years of the crucifixion.",
    "The creed names multiple witnesses, including Cephas (Peter), James, the twelve, and a group of more than 500, which underscores the widespread nature of the resurrection appearances.",
    "The transmission formula (\"received\" and \"delivered\") is similar to how Jewish rabbis passed on sacred tradition, and the use of the Aramaic name \"Cephas\" points to a Semitic style and Jewish-Christian origins in Jerusalem."
