He did this by highlighting the steadfast endurance of the apostles and other believers. He specifically stated that \"Paul himself and the rest of the Apostles ran not in vain but in faith and righteousness,\" and that they \"suffered.\" As someone who had likely known the apostles and their followers personally, Polycarp offers an early confirmation that the suffering of the apostles was closely connected to the message of the resurrection.",
